## What's this?

It presents `yarn audit` output in a compact table, ordered by severity.

## Usage

```sh
yarn audit --json | npx compact-yarn-audit
```

> Note: yarn's audit output can be quite large (gigabytes for a sizeable
> monorepo that hasn't had updates for a while), so it can take
> some time to process all that data.

## Why?

The default output of yarn's `audit` is verbose (just like npm's audit is).
When there's more than 3 vulnerabilities it doesn't fit on a screen anymore.
It also contains information I'm not interested in when I want to know what
to fix and with what urgency:

- What is the module _I_ used to import it (_via_ column)?
- If that's not possible what should I put in the _"resolutions" string_?
- Can it be fixed at all?
- How severe is the vulnerability (_severity_, _title_)? Preferably with the
  most severe ones on top.

This module attempts to fix that by leaving out all information not essential
to my use case.
